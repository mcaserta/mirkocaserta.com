## Long Story Short

This is an improvised music album. The sound is that of Hans Zimmer's organ in
Interstellar. The inspiration is clearly ecclesiastical. I tried to imagine
melodies based on the track titles and develop them by (poorly) mimicking
contrapuntal style.

## Short Story Long

My first job as a musician came quite early. I think I was in sixth grade when
my piano teacher proposed that I take his place as organist in the village
church.

I had never studied music theory properly, my reading ability was really
rudimentary and this made me nervous, but church music doesn't require great
performance skills: just a bit of an ear for chords and you can easily manage
most hymns.

My job was to accompany the choir during Sunday morning service. Sometimes I
would do afternoon rehearsals with the choir during the week, but this habit was
short-lived due to teenagers' predisposition to engage in activities like fights
and clumsy attempts at sexual reproduction.

My activity as an organist didn't last long. Once, during confirmations, I had
the brilliant idea of using the synthesizer to play some melodies and this
didn't please the bishop at all. The parish priest explained to me that only
acoustic instruments and the organ were allowed in church. Could I ever tolerate
having my artistic choices questioned? That's how my collaboration with the
parish abruptly ended.

I also remember once punching a choir boy in the face because he dared to
inappropriately comment on the LPs I was carrying that day: Invitation by Jaco
Pastorius, 8:30 by Weather Report and something by Larry Carlton if I remember
correctly. Then I apologized and borrowed his
[Fronte del Palco](https://it.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fronte_del_palco) CDs to
attempt a completely fake musical reconciliation on my part.

Anyway, for at least two or three years I actively participated in the parish
community's musical activities. I knew the most popular songs and knew when to
insert them in the various sections of religious services. I was a decent church
boy, but I always viewed with detachment the many aspects of Christian practice
that visibly clash with reality and my skeptical and rational approach to life's
matters.

Already at that time, the idea had made its way into me that there is no god and
that the many senseless things about religions are such not because I'm unable
to understand them or for lack of faith, but simply because they are and remain
senseless and contrary to logic and reason available to any minimally educated
person.

All this to say that somehow this music is a return to origins for me. I had fun
going back to the organ bench, albeit a virtual one[^hz].
