# Krik

![Krik logo](../../images/posts/krik.png)

I spent the last 2-3 days developing a static site generator in Rust using
exclusively [Claude Code](https://claude.ai/).

My knowledge of Rust is quite basic: I understand code when it's well written
but I don't yet have the practice necessary to develop a sophisticated tool.

However, for this project I didn't have to touch a single line of code, since I
gave all the instructions to Claude. The AI even took care of the releases.

The impression I had using this tool is the same one I had in the '90s when I
saw the Internet for the first time.

I don't think there's anything else to add.

Oh, yes... the project can be found on
[github](https://github.com/mcaserta/krik) and a demo of the generated site is
[here](https://krik.mirkocaserta.com).
