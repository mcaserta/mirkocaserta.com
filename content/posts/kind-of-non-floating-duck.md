"In the beginning was the word."

"Ah, I thought it was the subject. But indeed, if you listen to Master Yoda..."

"Caserta, don't be a smartass. I wanna see how you handle global warming."

"Eh, whatever, we're all gonna die, what's the big deal? It wouldn't be the
first time."

(in a low voice): "This one, put him in the third division."

"I heard you, you know? In the third division[^1] they're all friends of mine.
Before you know it, I'll reach the final and win on penalties. You know how we
Italians are..."

(in a very low voice): "Call the hitman, I have a little job for him."

"Excuse me, Your Eminence..."

"Don't call me Your Eminence, that's someone else entirely."

"What should I call you?"

"Miles is fine. It's informal but it still inspires a certain fear."

"Listen, Mr. Miles, all the musicians here are starving to death."

"Son, I did everything I could do."

"Eh, I know, but indeed, for God's sake, who's saying anything? Even though all
that pop stuff..."

"You see, you don't understand anything?"

"I know, I know, but indeed I'm studying a bit of everything, eh."

"Good, go study a bit of everything, go."

"Mr. Miles, but everything... everything? Even Nino D'Angelo?"

"Besides, I like Nino D'Angelo, everyone knows that. But why, if he pays you,
what do you do, don't you go?"

"Of course! If only."

"Good! Then go, go! And keep studying because on Giant Steps in 13/8 I can hear
you're a bit too shabby still."

"Man, odd time signatures aren't really my cup of tea."

"Are you kidding? Did you hear that little kid? Bread..."

"...Mehldau, yeah. Who by the way isn't really a little kid anymore either."

"But he does an All The Things in 7/4 that makes the audience dance the
Macarena."

"If that's the case, there are certain little kids on YouTube who, you know,
they're really something."

"Good. You see, you understand?"

"I understand, yeah. I have to learn these odd time signatures too, eh?"

"Of course man!"

"Mr. Miles, I think it would have been better if I hadn't bothered you."

"Eh, by now (...) You know what? Since you're here, go find that loony bin
bassist. Get yourself a lesson."

"Mr. Miles, is it true that here you always do jam sessions? After dinner I get
sleepy. These guys play until dawn, damn."

"You have to eat light, my son."

"Mr. Miles, why do you speak Roman?"

"Here you can study languages and since I've always been a bit rough... I liked
Roman, okay?"

"Okay, okay, don't get mad. Thanks Mr. Miles."

"And don't call me Mr. Miles."

"All right, Mr. Miles. Now I really have to go, bye."

"Bye kiddo."
